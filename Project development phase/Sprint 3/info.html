					<h3>Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system</h3>
					<p>Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination.
                    Symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. They may also have mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.</p>
 
                    <h3>Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tremor in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head</li>
                        <li>Muscle stiffness, where muscle remains contracted for a long time</li>
                        <li>Slowness of movement</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>Diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease</h3>
                      <p>There are currently no blood or laboratory tests to diagnose non-genetic cases of Parkinson’s. Doctors usually diagnose the disease by taking a person’s medical history and performing a neurological examination. If symptoms improve after starting to take medication, it’s another indicator that the person has Parkinson’s.</p>
